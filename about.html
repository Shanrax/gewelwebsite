                <h1>MALENIA, BLADE OF MIQUELLA</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="par"> Malenia was born the child of Queen Marika the Eternal and her second husband, the Elden Lord Radagon.
                    <br> She had an elder twin brother by the name of Miquella.<br> Both Malenia and Miquella were Empyreans, meaning they had the potential to one day replace their mother as a new god of a coming age. 
                    <br>But since Radagon and Marika were in fact the same person, Malenia and Miquella were born afflicted. Malenia was afflicted with the Scarlet Rot, 
                    <br>which ravaged her from within and would cost her several limbs, while Miquella was afflicted with eternal childhood, unable to ever grow into adulthood.
                    <br>
                    <br>At some point, Malenia encountered a blind swordsman who had sealed away an Outer God of Rot. The swordsman became her master, and trained her in the ways of the blade,
                    <br>allowing her to gain wings of unparalleled strength. Malenia would eventually become a warrior without peer. She would attract loyal servants like her Cleanrot Knights (who vowed to fight next to her despite the inevitable gradual putrefaction of their flesh),
                    <br>as well as worshippers, who believed her a goddess. Members of House Marais, who were all sickly born, were naturally drawn to the beautiful and fierce Malenia who became such a powerful warrior in spite of being born into rot, and requiring prosthesis to fight.
                    <br>
                    <br>Malenia and Miquella were close, and Malenia would become her brother's sworn blade and protector, while Miquella worked tirelessly to try and undo the curses they had both been born into. While unable to find a cure for his sister,
                    <br> Miquella designed a needle of unalloyed gold that could keep the Scarlet Rot ravaging Malenia's body at bay.
